# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

## Introduction
In this repository, I will be implementing various machine learning algorithms from scratch to deepen my understanding of their inner workings. Instead of relying on libraries like scikit-learn, I will code each algorithm manually and provide detailed explanations alongside the implementations.

## Goals
- Gain a deeper conceptual understanding of machine learning algorithms.
- Reinforce mathematical foundations by implementing algorithms step by step.
- Share my learning journey with others through well-documented code and explanations.

## Planned Implementations
Some of the algorithms I plan to implement include:
- **Supervised Learning**
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Neural Networks
- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Optimization Techniques**
  - Gradient Descent
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

## Structure
Each algorithm will be organized in a separate folder containing:
- Python implementation of the algorithm.
- Explanation of the theory and mathematics behind it.
- Example usage and testing on sample datasets.
